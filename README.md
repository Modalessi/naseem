generate static website from a couple of markdown files.

in an aim, to replace obsidian publish (which is great btw). i decided to make my own tool from sratch (no third party libraries), to generate a static website from markdown files.

right now it is no where near to obsidian publish, and there are alots of things messing. but i will try to improve on it by time.
